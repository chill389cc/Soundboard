# Write and debug micropython code on the picos
1. Flash the board with the micropython base image here:
https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html#drag-and-drop-micropython
2. Install Thonny (I'm sure there are cooler ways but this is easy and works)
https://thonny.org/
3. Open up Thonny
4. Open up a one of the python scripts in this folder
5. In the bottom-right corner, select the raspberry pi pico (it'll be something like `MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)`)
6. Press <kbd>F5</kbd> or click the green arrow
7. check the board or console for expected behavior
